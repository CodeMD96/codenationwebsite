                    This is definitely not placeholder text. A lot of thought and effort went into this text so I would really appreciate it if you took the time out of your day and read every word of this. In fact it would mean so much to me that I'm shedding a tear just at the thought. I really do understand how precious your time must be, we only get so long on this mortal coil after all, so the fact that you chose to spend yours reading this is truly wonderful. You sincerely have my eternal gratitude.
